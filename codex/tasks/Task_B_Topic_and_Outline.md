# Task B – Topic Modeling & Outline Design

## Objective
Translate research insights into a detailed article outline with on-page SEO targeting and UX considerations.

## Prerequisites
- Task A outputs finalized and accessible.
- Scholar Hybrid prompt ready for ideation (`/codex/assets/01_Scholar_Hybrid_Prompt.md`).

## Actions
1. Build a topical map covering primary, secondary, and supporting clusters.
2. Draft an H1–H3 outline including target keyword focus per section.
3. Identify multimedia opportunities (charts, screenshots, downloads).
4. Log outline decisions in `outline_blueprint.md` within the article-specific folder.
5. Apply Completeness Rules: ensure each section addresses what/who/how/timeline/risks/alternatives.

## Outputs
- `outline_blueprint.md`
- `topical_map.mindnode` or compatible format

## Quality Checks
- Outline mirrors search intent uncovered in Task A.
- Each section has a primary keyword and reader takeaway.
- Word-count allocations balance conversion goals and readability.
